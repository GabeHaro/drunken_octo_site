Web Stuff
---------

Colours used on the website are in colours.txt. Helvetica (excellent choice - Gabe) is used on the website, of varying weights, most text being 300, titles being 600, and subtitles being 400. Subject to change. 
I have a live version of the site available here: http://f.cl.ly/items/2O2U1m141W2T1k2I350r/main.html


Code Stuff
----------

Gabe will add something here eventually.

File Format Stuff
----------

Scouting info: This file will consist of a .csv format. Each row will represent a team profile for the event. Each column will contain a certain piece of info and is labelled in the first row. A different file will be created per event/user combo. An example has been uploaded as test_competition.csv (some fun was had with it though) (also, Excel will complain if you open it but just keep clicking ok and it will show up eventually).

Key info: One or several files will be used to store specialized info. This will include user ID codes, event ID codes, and existing categories for certain inputs. This will allow for easier database management.  
More thought to come to this as we go.
