=================

For now all this is containing is the code for the website, although Gabe and Isaac, as well as the iCanScout team, you guys are all more than welcome to add your own code here, it might be nice to have it all in one big repo that we can all see and download whenever.

Colours used on the website are in colours.txt. Helvetica is used on the website, of varying weights, most text being 300, titles being 600, and subtitles being 400. Subject to change.
